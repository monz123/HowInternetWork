            <p class="text-justify">Every machine on a network has a unique identifier. Just as you would address a letter to send in the mail, computers use the unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. Most networks today, including all computers on the internet, use the TCP/IP protocol as the standard for how to communicate on the network. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.</p>

                IPv4 uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by four numbers separated by dots. Each number is the decimal (base-10) representation for an eight-digit binary (base-2) number, also called an octet. For example: 216.27.61.137

                IPv6 uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers separated by colons, as in 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652. Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often omitted to save space, leaving a colon separator to mark the gap (as in 2001:cdba::3257:9652).

                It turns out that everything you do on the Internet involves packets. For example, every Web page that you receive comes as a series of packets, and every e-mail you send leaves as a series of packets. Networks that ship data around in small packets are called packet switched networks. Each packet carries the information that will help it get to its destination.

                These instructions may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Length of packet (some networks have fixed-length packets, while others rely on the header to contain this information)</li>
                <li>Synchronization (a few bits that help the packet match up to the network)</li>
                <li>Packet number (which packet this is in a sequence of packets)</li>
                <li>Protocol (on networks that carry multiple types of information, the protocol defines what type of packet is being transmitted: e-mail, Web page, streaming video)</li>

                <li>Originating address (where the packet came from)</li>

            <p>The trailer, sometimes called the footer, typically contains a couple of bits that tell the receiving device that it has reached the end of the packet. It may also have some type of error checking. The most common error checking used in packets is Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). sender's IP address, the intended receiver's IP address, something that tells the network how many packets this e-mail message has been broken into and the number of this particular packet. The packets carry the data in the protocols that the Internet uses: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Each packet contains part of the body of your message. A typical packet contains perhaps 1,000 or 1,500 bytes.</p>

                <b>Step 3: Router forwards packet</b></p>

            <p class="text-justify">The router has multiple paths it could send a packet along, and its goal is to send the packet to a router that's closer to its final destination.
                How does it decide? The router has a forwarding table that helps it pick the next path based on the destination IP address. That table does not have a row for every possible IP address; there are
                2
                32
                2
                32
                2, start superscript, 32, end superscript possible IP addresses, and that's far too much to store. Instead, the table has rows for IP address prefixes.

                P addresses are hierarchical. When two IP addresses start with the same prefix, that often means they're on the same large network,Router forwarding tables take advantage of that fact so that they can store far less information.
                Once the router locates the most specific row in the table for the destination IP address, it sends the packet along that path.

            <p class="text-justify">If all goes well, the packet should eventually arrive at a router that knows exactly where to send it.

                The router can now send the message to the destination IP address, which may be a personal computer or a server.
