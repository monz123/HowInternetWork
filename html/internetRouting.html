            <p>Every machine on a network has a unique identifier. Just as you would address a letter to send in the mail, computers use the unique identifier to send data to specific computers on a network. Most networks today, including all computers on the internet, use the TCP/IP protocol as the standard for how to communicate on the network. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.

                There are two standards for IP addresses: IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6). All computers with IP addresses have an IPv4 address, and most use the new IPv6 address system as well.</p>

            IPv4 uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by four numbers separated by dots. Each number is the decimal (base-10) representation for an eight-digit binary (base-2) number, also called an octet. For example: 216.27.61.137
            IPv6 uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers separated by colons, as in 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652. Groups of numbers that contain all zeros are often omitted to save space, leaving a colon separator to mark the gap (as in 2001:cdba::3257:9652).

            <p>some numbers in that range are reserved for specific purposes on TCP/IP networks. These reservations are recognized by the authority on TCP/IP addressing, the internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Four specific reservations include the following:

                0.0.0.0: This represents the default network, which is the abstract concept of just being connected to a TCP/IP network.
                255.255.255.255: This address is reserved for network broadcasts, or messages that should go to all computers on the network.
                127.0.0.1: This is called the loopback address, meaning your computer's way of identifying itself, whether or not it has an assigned IP address.
                169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254: This is the Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) range of addresses assigned automatically when a computer's unsuccessful getting an address from a DHCP server.</p>
            <p>FINDING YOUR IP ADDRESS
                In Windows, search for "cmd" (without the quotes) using Windows search and hit Enter. In the resulting pop-up box, type "ipconfig" (no quote marks). For Macs, go to System Preferences, select Network, and you should see it. For mobile phone IP addresses, go to Settings, then WiFi and to the network you're on. The IP address might be found under "Advanced" or "(i)" depending on the type of phone you have.</p>

    <h1>Packets</h1>
    <p>It turns out that everything you do on the Internet involves packets. For example, every Web page that you receive comes as a series of packets, and every e-mail you send leaves as a series of packets. Networks that ship data around in small packets are called packet switched networks.</p>
    <p>Each packet carries the information that will help it get to its destination -- the sender's IP address, the intended receiver's IP address, something that tells the network how many packets this e-mail message has been broken into and the number of this particular packet. The packets carry the data in the protocols that the Internet uses: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Each packet contains part of the body of your message. A typical packet contains perhaps 1,000 or 1,500 bytes.</p>
    <h1>Routing</h1>
    In the Internet Protocol (IP), computers split messages into packets and those packets hop from router to router on the way to their destination:

    Step 1: Send packet to router

    Computers send the first packet to the nearest router. A router is a type of computing device used in computer networks that helps move the packets along.
    Step 2: Router receives packet

    When the router receives a packet, it looks at its IP header. The most important field is the destination IP address, which tells the router where the packet wants to end up.
    Step 3: Router forwards packet

    The router has multiple paths it could send a packet along, and its goal is to send the packet to a router that's closer to its final destination.
    How does it decide? The router has a forwarding table that helps it pick the next path based on the destination IP address. That table does not have a row for every possible IP address; there are
    2
    32
    2
    32
    2, start superscript, 32, end superscript possible IP addresses, and that's far too much to store. Instead, the table has rows for IP address prefixes.

    P addresses are hierarchical. When two IP addresses start with the same prefix, that often means they're on the same large network,Router forwarding tables take advantage of that fact so that they can store far less information.
    Once the router locates the most specific row in the table for the destination IP address, it sends the packet along that path.
    Step 4: Final router forwards message

    If all goes well, the packet should eventually arrive at a router that knows exactly where to send it.

    The router can now send the message to the destination IP address, which may be a personal computer or a server.
