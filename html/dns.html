            <p class="text-justify"> A Domain Name System is a database that translates the user-friendly host names that we use to browse the Internet (e.g. plus.net) into a numerical format understood by computers, known as IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.124.1.).

                DNS is an integral part of how the internet works, as it allows users and hosts to utilise more memorable DNS names rather than having to use a website's IP address to access a website.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-5">
            <p class="text-justify"> When a user wants to access a webpage, they enter the address (or DNS name) into their browser's address bar. This information is then sent in the form of a 'DNS query' to their Internet Service Provider's (ISP) DNS servers. Every ISP has a database of DNS names and their corresponding IP addresses. If a user's initial query can be answered using this directory, an 'authoritative' answer is sent to the user's computer so they can connect with the website.

                If the ISP directory is unable to answer the initial DNS query authoritatively, then its next step would be to check its cache. A server's cache holds a record of all other previous queries. If it can answer a user using information from the cache, then it will still answer but with a 'non-authoritative' answer. This means that the information you're being supplied with isn't directly from your ISP's directory, but from a third party.

                If your query still can't be answered, then the DNS query process will use recursion. This is when your ISP's DNS survey uses the information it has on other authoritative servers in its root hint files to contact and get the information you need. Once an ISP has requested this information, it is sent to a user's computer, where a connection is formed. The ISP server then stores that information in its cache which can be then accessed for future queries.</p>
